To run these tests, make sure haskelldb is installed with the database
driver you want to use. Then, in the test/ directory:

  ghc --make DescDB1.hs
  ./DescDB1 

Install Test.Hunit and Text.Regex:

  cabal install HUnit
  cabal install regex-compat

To test against postgres, using HDBC:

  ghc --make test-hdbc-postgresql.hs
  ./test-hdbc-postgresql -h <host> -d <database> -u <user> -p <password>
  
And similarly for the other database and driver combinations.
